# Green Thumb

Ever wish you could bonemeal a cactus?  There are several plants in Minecraft which you can't grow using Bone Meal.  Green Thumb both addresses that and gives you a use for all that Rotten Flesh you have laying around.

### Fertilizer

To give Rotten Flesh a use, and make plant growth require just a bit more resources, you can no longer grow plants with Bone Meal alone.  Instead, craft Bone Meal together with Rotten Flesh to produce Crude Fertilizer, which works exactly like vanilla Bone Meal.

Don't like it?  Think it's a stupid change?  Just disable it in `config/GreenThumb.cfg` by setting `greenthumb.enable_fertilizer` to false.  Bone Meal will once again grow plants on its own, including the new plants listed below.

### Plants

#### Cactus

Cactus works just like Cocoa Beans.  Plant one yourself, then fertilize it to make it grow up to two more stages.  Fertilizing a cactus three blocks or taller has no effect.

#### Lily Pad

Finally, renewable Lily Pads!  They work similarly to natural mushroom growth, appearing on a random water block near the fertilized pad if the local Lily Pad density isn't already too high.

#### Melon Stem

You can now continue fertilizing a Melon Stem after it's fully grown.  Doing so will cause a Melon to grow, if one isn't already grown.

#### Nether Wart

Nether Wart works just like carrots and potatoes.  Plant it, fertilize 2-3 times for full growth, and harvest.

#### Pumpkin Stem

You can now continue fertilizing a Pumpkin Stem after it's fully grown.  Doing so will cause a Pumpkin to grow, if one isn't already grown.

#### Sugar Canes

Sugar Canes work just like Cocoa Beans.  Plant one yourself, then fertilize it to make it grow up to two more stages.  Fertilizing a cane three blocks or taller has no effect.

#### Vines

Fertilizing a vine will cause it to grow one block downward.
